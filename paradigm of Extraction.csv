Elements: Co, Ni, Fe, Mo, Cr",Scalable Synthesis of Multi-Metal Electrocatalyst Powders and Electrodes and their Application for Oxygen Evolution and Water Splitting,"Multi-metal electrocatalysts provide nearly unlimited catalytic possibilities arising from synergistic element interactions. We propose a polymer/metal precursor spraying technique that can easily be adapted to produce a large variety of compositional different multi-metal catalyst materials. To demonstrate this, 11 catalysts were synthesized, characterized, and investigated for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Further investigation of the most active OER catalyst, namely CoNiFeMoCr, revealed a polycrystalline structure, and operando Raman measurements indicate that multiple active sites are participating in the reaction. Moreover, Ni foam-supported CoNiFeMoCr electrodes were developed and applied for water splitting in flow-through electrolysis cells with electrolyte gaps and in zero-gap membrane electrode assembly (MEA) configurations. The proposed alkaline MEA-type electrolyzers reached up to 3 A cm−2, and 24 h measurements demonstrated no loss of current density of 1 A cm−2."

Elements: Pt, Ir, Fe, Co, Cu",Engineering Structurally Ordered High-Entropy Intermetallic Nanoparticles with High-Activity Facets for Oxygen Reduction in Practical Fuel Cells,"High-entropy solid-solution alloys have generated significant interest in energy conversion technologies. However, structurally ordered high-entropy intermetallic (HEI) nanoparticles (NPs) have been rarely reported in electrocatalysis applications. Here, we demonstrate structurally ordered PtIrFeCoCu HEI (PIFCC-HEI) NPs with extremely superior performance for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and H2/O2 fuel cells. The PIFCC-HEI NPs show an average diameter of 6 nm. Atomic structural characterizations including atomic-resolution energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping technology confirm the ordered intermetallic structure of PIFCC-HEI NPs. As an electrocatalyst for ORR, the PIFCC-HEI/C achieves an ultrahigh mass activity of 7.14 A mgnoble metals–1 at 0.85 V and extraordinary durability over 60 000 potential cycles. Moreover, the fuel cell assembled with PIFCC-HEI/C as the cathode delivers an ultrahigh peak power density of 1.73 W cm–2 at a back pressure of 1.0 bar and almost no working voltage decay after 80 h operation, certifying the top-level performance among reported fuel cells. Theoretical calculations combined with experimental results reveal that the superior performance of PIFCC-HEI/C for ORR and fuel cells is attributed to its ultrahigh-activity facets. Especially, the (001) facet affords the lowest activation barriers for the rate-limiting step, the optimal downshift of the d-band center, and more efficient regulation of electron structures for ORR. This work not only opens up a new avenue for the fabrication of high-activity facets in the catalysts but also highlights structurally ordered HEI NPs as sufficiently effective catalysts in practical fuel cells and other potential energy-related applications."
